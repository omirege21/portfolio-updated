			Contact us with your requirements and we will help you find a destination that meets your budget and needs! Our team has a list of destinations across the world that are not frequented by North American travellers. Our goal is to matche
			one of these destinations with your travel dates and budget. We are also cognizant of local cultures and avoid burdening destinations with excessive tourism. We work closely with local partners to build these trips and make sure that everyone has a tremendous experience.
			</p>
			<br /><br>

		<p> 
			Once you contact us, our travel team will reach out to you with suggested destinations and their approximate costs. We will also have a brief interview with you and other travellers to ensure that the people making these trips are focused on building inter-cultural connections. 
			Examples of some of our past destinations include: Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, Bolivia, Algeria, and Laos.
