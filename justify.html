		The world is full of plentiful options for your next vacation. Explore a new country, learn a new language, immerse yourself in a different culture, and save yourself money along the way.
		Most of our destination suggestions are budget-conscious. We ensure that we select destinations that will make your money go further. In many cities we suggest, you will be able to get by each day for the same price as a large pizza!
		</p>
		<br /><br>


		<p> In addition to saving you money, our goal is to also help you explore new cultures. Maputo or Jordan may offer you more to learn, do, and enjoy on your next vacation. We hope that whichever adventure you choose will be an eye-opening experience.
